## Original vs Next.js Version

This is a refactored version of the original Head Ball game that:
- Uses Next.js for easier development and testing
- Maintains all original functionality
- Provides a built-in development server
- Improves asset serving through Next.js public directory
- Maintains the same game mechanics and visual assets

The game works exactly the same as the original version but is now easier to develop and deploy.
